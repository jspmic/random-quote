# Description
This project generates a random quote using API-Ninjas. It is simple and beginner-friendly.

# Usage
The preliminary actions on your side are simple. Read the code and learn how to interact with an API(authentication, request headers and body, response headers and body, ...).
I intend to implement an API that uses XML rather than JSON to illustrate how we interact with an API.

- First, create an account on https://api-ninjas.com/ (it's free)
- Then paste your API key in the `api_key` file
- Run `python quotes.py`, follow the prompts and you should see a quote!
> If no category is provided, it generates a quote on a random category.

# What's next
Checkout my <a href="https://github.com/jspmic/rest-api">rest-api</a> repository. It will provide an insight into how RESTful APIs are crafted.

# Closing thought
You're welcome to tell me which API is the coolest among others(in any domain except ML/DL, i'm a noob in those fields) and i'll take a look ASAP!
