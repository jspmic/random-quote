# Description
This project uses a random quote using API-Ninjas. It is simple and beginner-friendly.

# Usage
The preliminary actions on your side are simple. I didn't use the .env file to keep this as simple as i can.
Read the code and learn how to interact with an API(authentication, request headers and body required or not, response content format, ...).
I intend to implement an API that uses XML rather than JSON to illustrate how we interact with an API.

- First, create an account on https://api-ninjas.com/ (it's free)
- Then paste your API key in the api_key file
- Run quotes.py and you should see a quote(Provide a Category if needed)

# What's next
Checkout my <a href="https://github.com/jspmic/rest-api">rest-api</a> repository. It will provide an insight into how RESTful APIs are crafted.

# Closing thought
You're welcome to tell me which API is the best among others(in any domain) and i'll take a look asap!
